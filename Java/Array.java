/*
Dynamic memory Allocation:
---------------------------
Array Object are in Heap Section
Heap Objects are not continuous
Dynamic Memory Allocation
Java Does not have continuous memory allocations
Primitive : The Data type which cannot be broken down

By Default for an object if there is nothing it will be none

Notes :

There are two memory types
stack memory and Heap memory

Stack:

Heap: This is array data list type of this to be deleted into a main array

this could be the best key mainly this keyboard woul be best in typing
happy to see that keyboard is better in typeing data to be noted mainly be better dev to be as also

Dynamic memory allocation to be developed maintain to be dispatched

Dynamic Memory Allocation due to be issued data
